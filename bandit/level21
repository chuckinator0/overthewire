echo "<old password>" | nc -l -p 60000 &
The above  command echoes the bandit20 password into netcat,
which serves the message on port 60000 and goes in the background.
Then, `./suconnect 60000` reads the message on that port and gives the
password to bandit21.

NOTE: MacOS netcat doesn't use the -p flag, which made this a bit of a pain in the butt.
