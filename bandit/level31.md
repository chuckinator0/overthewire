For this one, we do the same as before (go to `/tmp/chuck`, make a new directory, clone the repo there including `.git` at the end of the repo name, cd into the repo). Obviously there's just a useless README.md there. No branches or commits to investigate. However, going into the `.git` repo showed a `packed_refs` file -- a file that contains references to tags and commits and stuff. There was a "secrets" tag with an ID. I used `git show <ID>` to get the password.
